Missing data is a recurrent problem when dealing with real-world contexts and is usually handled with imputation strategies that replace the missing values with new data. Several deep-learning techniques have been used to address this issue, and one of them is the Autoencoder and its Denoising and Variational variants. These models can learn a representation of the data with the missing values and can produce plausible replacement values for the missing ones. The goal of this work is to perform a comparative study between different imputation techniques including Autoencoder and its Denoising and Variational variants. In this study, MNIST, ART and Brain Tumor MRI image datasets were used to compare imputation methods. All images were injected with missing values under different missing rates for the Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) and a specific block pixel in the image were removed for Missing Not At Random (MNAR) mechanisms. Denoising Autoencoders showed better imputation results when the background is common i.e., for MNIST dataset for both MCAR and MNAR  mechanisms. The Linear imputation showed better results for MCAR mechanism when background is complex i.e., for Art and Brain Tumor image datasets.
